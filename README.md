[Grido](http://o5.github.io/grido-examples/)
=============

This is fork o5/grido repo updated for working with Nette 2.4.

## Original description (from Grido author):

Grido is an extension for [Nette Framework](http://nette.org/). Grido helps you with data listing, formatting, sorting, paging, filtering, editing, bulk actions and exporting them.
It doesn't matter which datasource you are using. For now, Grido works with [Nette Database](https://github.com/nette/database), [Dibi](https://github.com/dg/dibi), [Doctrine](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2) and ArraySource (raw PHP Arrays).
You can try it in [live demo](http://grido.bugyik.cz/example/)!
